    "It is time to start using what you have learned throughout the first half of this course by developing an original data mining project. This week you will develop the project idea and do some data exploration/graphical analysis. You will continue working on and updating this project for the remainder of the term. The following link includes a sample project completed in Jupyter Notebook: Titanic Model Building Project Sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is coming up with an idea â€“ arguably one of the hardest steps! Identify an original business problem for your project that can be solved with an appropriate model. By a business problem, it is meant that you should work on a problem where there is a good reason to solve it. There should be some organization or company that would find the solution to the problem useful. There are lots of ideas available online through Kaggle and other sources, but your idea should have a unique spin on it. The second step is locating your data. This can come from a variety of sources, e.g., Kaggle, your job, a website, API, etc. Feel free to reach out to your instructor if you are not sure if your idea and data are suitable. You may need to adjust your idea on the availability of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begin Milestone 1 with a 250-500-word narrative describing your original idea for the analysis/model building business problem. Clearly identify the problem you will address and the target for your model. Then, do a graphical analysis creating a minimum of four graphs. Label your graphs appropriately and explain/analyze the information provided by each graph. Your analysis should begin to answer the question(s) you are addressing. Write a short overview/conclusion of the insights gained from your graphical analysis.\n",
